"""A writer-preferring reader-writer lock.

Many searches can hold the read lock at once (the C++ search releases the GIL, so they really
run in parallel). An upsert or delete takes the write lock and waits for running searches to
finish; while a writer is waiting, new readers queue behind it so writers cannot starve.
